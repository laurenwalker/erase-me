# Erase Me  - Erase your activity on Facebook

> Facebook is a surveillance company rebranded as social media.

## Unlike and Remove Reactions
To unlike and remove reactions from content, go to your activity log and select "Likes and Reactions" (You can further filter this by posts and comments or pages and interests). Copy/paste the contents of `run.js` into the developer console. After the code has run and more activity loads on the page, just repeat `unlikeEverything()` until you're done.
